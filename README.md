# Multi-Person Pose Estimation using Body Parts

Code and pre-trained models for our paper "*Multi-Person Pose Estimation Based on Body Parts*" (under review).

This repo is the **Part A** of our paper project.

**Pat B** is in the repo on GitHub: [**Improved-Body-Parts**](https://github.com/jialee93/Improved-Body-Parts)

## Introduction

A bottom-up approach for the problem of multi-person pose estimation. This **Part** is based on the network backbones in [CMU-Pose](https://github.com/ZheC/Realtime_Multi-Person_Pose_Estimation) (namely OpenPose). A modified network is also trained and evalutated. 

### Contents

1. Training 
2. Evaluation 
3. Demo

### Task Lists

- [ ] Add more descriptions and complete the project

## Project Features

- Implement the models using **Keras with TensorFlow backend**
- VGG as the backbone
- No batch normalization layer 
- Supprot training on multiple GPUs and slice training samples among GPUs
- Fast data preparing and augmentation during training
- Different learning rate at different layers

## Prepare

1. Download the COCO dataset 
2. [Download the pre-trained models from Dropbox](https://www.dropbox.com/s/bsr03ahhnaxppnf/model%26demo.rar?dl=0) 
3. Change the paths in the code according to your environment

## Run a Demo

`python demo_image.py`

## Evaluation Steps

The corresponding code is in pure python without multiprocess for now.

`python testing/evaluation.py`

```

According to our results, the performance of posenet/model3 in this repo is similar to CMU-Net (the cascaed CNN used in [CMU-Pose](https://github.com/ZheC/Realtime_Multi-Person_Pose_Estimation) ), which means only merging different feature maps with diferent receptive fields at low resolution heatmaps could not help much.

## News!

Recently, we are lucky to have time and machine to utilize. Thus, we revisit our previous work. More accurate results had been achieved after we adopted more powerful Network and use higher resolution of heatmaps (stride=4). Enhanced models with body part representation, variant loss functions and training parameters have been tried.
